# 🛒 CartBuddy API

**CartBuddy** is a personal shopping list app designed to help users organize their purchases, track item availability, monitor price trends, and understand what’s increasing their spending over time.

This API, built with **NestJS** and **MongoDB**, serves as the backend for the system, handling the storage, processing, and delivery of data to the mobile application.

> This project is developed by me for personal use, with the goal of learning, exploring NestJS + MongoDB in practice, and applying ideas around consumption, price control, and shopping routine organization.

---

## 📌 Overview

CartBuddy starts simple:

- Create shopping lists
- Add items to a list
- Mark a list as completed or with missing items

Planned future enhancements:

- Mark specific items as bought or missing
- Add unit price and quantity per item
- Calculate total purchase cost
- Track item price changes over time
- Identify which items impact the total cost the most
- Store and view historical lists and purchases
- Add authentication and multi-user support

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **NestJS** – Scalable framework for building server-side applications with TypeScript
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing lists, items, and history
- **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB schema modeling
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed language for code clarity and safety

🏗️ Architecture and Folder Structure
This project follows the Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal) architecture to maintain separation of concerns, scalability, and testability. The layers are organized as:

```plaintext
src/
├── domain/                   # Pure business entities and value objects
│   ├── entities/
│   └── value-objects/
│
├── application/              # Use cases orchestrating business logic
│
├── ports/                    # Interfaces defining system boundaries (Ports)
│   ├── inbound/              # Inbound ports (e.g., controller interfaces)
│   └── outbound/             # Outbound ports (e.g., repository interfaces)
│
├── adapters/                 # Implementations of ports (Adapters)
│   ├── inbound/              # Inbound adapters (e.g., HTTP controllers)
│   ├── outbound/             # Outbound adapters (e.g., MongoDB repositories)
│   └── messaging/            # Messaging adapters (e.g., SNS, queues)
│
├── shared/                   # Shared utilities, helpers, constants
│
└── main.ts                   # Application entry point
```

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is under active development. The initial version (V1) focuses on basic features with no authentication, but it is structured for future scalability.
