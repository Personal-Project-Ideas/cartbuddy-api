# 🛒 CartBuddy API

**CartBuddy** is a personal shopping list app designed to help users organize their purchases, track item availability, monitor price trends, and understand what’s increasing their spending over time.

This API, built with **NestJS** and **MongoDB**, serves as the backend for the system, handling the storage, processing, and delivery of data to the mobile application.

> This project is developed by me for personal use, with the goal of learning, exploring NestJS + MongoDB in practice, and applying ideas around consumption, price control, and shopping routine organization.

## 📌 Overview

CartBuddy starts simple:

- Create shopping lists
- Add items to a list
- Mark a list as completed or with missing items

Planned future enhancements:

- Mark specific items as bought or missing
- Add unit price and quantity per item
- Calculate total purchase cost
- Track item price changes over time
- Identify which items impact the total cost the most
- Store and view historical lists and purchases
- Add authentication and multi-user support
